GraphTest.c:  Tests the functions of Graph.c in isolation.

FindPath.c:  Handles input and output.  Uses Graph.c functions to compute the distance of a path between two vertices and also prints out the sortest path between the vertices provided one exists.

Makefile:  Makes the files into an excecutable called FindPath
